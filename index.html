\n This article describes more or less the situations for most Chinese scholars I know that are/were doing a PhD in NL with external funding.
"Two leaflets" was actually truly what most CSC students got from the university when they started their life here. The big problem is indeed, we don’t know what we don’t know.
I have been through some of the difficulties. 
We grew up in a fast developing yet competetive environment. Everyone was constantly told by their parents and teachers that, "you only task is to study". We were not allowed to spend time developing other skills, such as to explore the nature, choose our favourite sports, or do some painting as a hobby, unless it helps to entering into a better university. It is clearly one of the reasons why a large percentage of Chinese students being shy and lack of social skills. 
And things should be done to make it better. 
 
Don't blame, but help.
